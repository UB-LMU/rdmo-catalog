# Mapping SMP-Catalogue to the FAIR4RS Principles

## Introduction
The FAIR4RS viewer is an additional feature for the SMP catalogue. Through the viewer, the answers from the catalogue are listed in the chronology of the FAIR4RS principles (https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00068). The display therefore rises and falls with one's own entries in the SMP catalogue.
The matching for the FAIR44Rs viewer is listed below. This shows which attributes are displayed at which position in the viewer. Currently, views are only possible in one language. Therefore, the viewer is only available in English for the time being.

## Findability
F: Software, and its associated metadata, is easy for both humans and machines to find
### F1. Software is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
#### F.1.1. Components of the software representing levels of granularity are assigned distinct identifiers
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/development-process
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/track-tasks
### F1.2. Different versions of the software are assigned distinct identifiers
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/versioning 
### F2. Software is described with rich metadata
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/software-metadata
### F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the software they describe
*See F4*
### F4. Metadata are FAIR, searchable and indexable
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/software-pid
## Accessibility
A: Software, and its metadata, is retrievable via standardized protocols
### A.1. Software is retrievable by its identifier using a standardized communications protocol
#### A.1.1. Software is retrievable by its identifier using a standardized communications protocol
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/software-pid
##### A.1.2. The protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/software-sharing 
### A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the software is no longer available
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/re-usable https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/preservation 
## Interoperability
I: Software interoperates with other software by exchanging data and/or metadata, and/or through interaction via application programming interfaces (APIs), described through standards
### I.1. Software reads, writes and exchanges data in a way that meets domain-relevant community standards
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/community-requirements
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/coding-standards
### I2. Software includes qualified references to other objects
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/web-services 
## Reusability
R: Software is both usable (can be executed) and reusable (can be understood, modified, built upon, or incorporated into other software)
### R1. Software is described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes
#### R1.1. Software is given a clear and accessible license
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/software-license
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/third-party-licenses
#### R1.2. Software is associated with detailed provenance
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/software-property-rights 
### R2. Software includes qualified references to other software
https://rdmorganiser.github.io/terms/domain/smp/external-components
### R3. Software meets domain-relevant community standards
